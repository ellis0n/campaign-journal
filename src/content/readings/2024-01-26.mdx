# A Most Potent Brew 

The town of <a href="https://forgottenmaps.web.app/map/Sword%20Coast/Nashkel">Nashkel</a> sits on the northern border of Amn, nestled into a valley that cuts through the Cloud Peaks. The town was historically sustained by iron ore mines that lined the rolling hills beneath the massive mountain range. Now, for over a hundred years, the mines have sat dormant following the events of the Iron Crisis, a period of political unrest caused by the abundant veins of ore suddenly producing only brittle, worthless slate. This change was precipitated by the actions of a dark wizard seeking to destablize the Amnian economy, which catalyzed a regional conflict between the northern city-state of Baldur's Gate and the southern nation of Amn. While the conflict was resolved and the magic that cursed the mines was lifted, hostile relations endured and the once-bustling mines sat in disrepair while the town of Nashkel slowly withered. It would be years before blacksmiths and traders would trust the ore again.

In recent years, however, the growing economies of the Sword Coast ever-growing need for iron ore overtook the flagging memory of war and the mines reopened. Nashkel slowly rebuilt itself into a small town servicing the frontier prospectors and miners who had set up camps in the hillside. The longstanding temple to <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lathander">Lathander</a> sits in the center of town, and the growing traffic through the mountain pass has brought new life to the dilapidated, old inn that sits across the street.
