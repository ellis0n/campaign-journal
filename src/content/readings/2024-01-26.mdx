# A Most Potent Brew 


The town of <a href="https://forgottenmaps.web.app/map/Sword%20Coast/Nashkel">Nashkel</a> sits on the northern border of Amn where the Coast Way cuts into the Cloud Peaks. Historically, those who lived and died in Nashkel and its surroundings were miners, prospectors and the merchants who serviced them. A small temple in the name of <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lathander">Lathander</a> overlooked the sparse town, comprised of just under a dozen homes, two inns and a blacksmith's shop. A large lake to the south of the town provided a source of fresh water for the surrounding mining camps, notably the <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Nashkel_Mines">Nashkel Mines</a>. On the edge of the lake a crumbling, three-story stone tower stood, said to have once been the home of a powerful alchemist and wizard.



For years, the miners wrestled iron ore from the rolling hillsides while the population of Nashkel grew to a few dozen. The ore was so plentiful, and of such reputable quality, that the Northern Cities grew dependent on the product. When the mines suddenly began to produce brittle, weak slate in areas where rich veins had been long confirmed, the shock to the supply of the Northern refinieries nearly collapsed industries. Eventually, it was uncovered that the resource had been cursed by a dark interloper in an attempt to manipulate a regional war between Amn and the Northern Cities. This resulted in the <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Crisis">Iron Crisis</a>, a period of economic turmoil that saw the Northern Cities and Amn on the brink of war. Major conflict was narrowly avoided and the curse on the mines was lifted, but not before the Northern Cities had entirely divested from Nashkel.Reduced trade in the antebellum years between Amn and Baldur's Gate saw the footpaths through Nashkel overgrown, and eventually only Lathander's cleric remained in the town.

Recently, things have turned around for Nashkel. <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Humans">Humans</a>, representing the majority of the population in the region, possess short lifespans and even shorter memories. Having put the Iron Crisis and the curse on Nashkel's yield behind them, the growing need for resources in the booming Northern Cities turned attention back towards the old mines. Relations between Amn and Baldur's Gate having effectively normalized, the town developed a small population to support the growing camps.

An enterprising innkeep, Targin Glowkindle, reopened one of the old inns, calling it The Mountain's Hearth, and it quickly became a popular drinking hole for the nearby miners. As more and more people began to pour through the valley on their way up and down the Sword Coast and into Amn, the bar became a popular meeting ground for traders, adventurers and mercenaries to meet. The innkeep's limited capacity to brew his own ale was quickly outpaced by demand, and he looked to the old alchemist's tower on the lake outside town as a potential space to expand his operation. Calling his new brewery The Mountain's Brew, Glowkindle began to produce a potent dark ale that quickly became a favorite of the miners and travelers alike.
